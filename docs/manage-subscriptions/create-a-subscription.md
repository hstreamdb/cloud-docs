# Create a Subscription

This tutorial guides you through creating a subscription in the dashboard.

## Step1. Preparation

1. If you do not have an account, [register an account first](../getting-started/apply-for-a-trial.md) and log in.

3. Click **Subscriptions** on the left sidebar to enter the subscriptions page.
4. Click **New Subscription** button to create a subscription.

## Step2. Create a subscription

After clicking the **New Subscription** button, a dialog will pop out. In the dialog, you need to set some necessary properties for your subscription and create it:

2. Select a stream as the source from the dropdown list.
3. Fill in with the **ACK timeout**. The default value is **60**. Unit is **second**.
4. Fill in the number of **max unacked records**. The default value is **100**.
5. Click the **Confirm** button to create a subscription.
